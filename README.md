# ThreatMapper Pro

**Intelligent Network Security Scanner with Threat Intelligence Integration**

ThreatMapper Pro is an advanced nmap automation script that transforms traditional network scanning into intelligent threat analysis. Built for cybersecurity teams who need more than basic port scanning - it provides vulnerability correlation, risk prioritization, and collaborative security workflows.

## Why ThreatMapper Pro?

Traditional nmap tools leave you with raw data. ThreatMapper Pro gives you **actionable intelligence**:

- **Intelligent Analysis**: Automatic vulnerability correlation with CVE databases
- **Risk Prioritization**: Smart risk scoring based on threat landscape
- **Executive Reporting**: Professional reports in JSON, CSV, and HTML formats
- **Team Collaboration**: Email notifications and shared reporting
- **Performance**: Multi-threaded scanning for enterprise networks
- **Banking-Grade Security**: Built with enterprise security requirements in mind

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SiteQ8/ThreatMapper.git
cd ThreatMapper

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Make executable
chmod +x threatmapper_pro.py
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Network Scan
```bash
# Quick scan of internal network
./threatmapper_pro.py -t 192.168.1.0/24

## Configuration

ThreatMapper Pro uses a JSON configuration file (`threatmapper_config.json`) that's automatically created on first run:

```json
{
  "scan_profiles": {
    "quick": "-sS -T4 -F",
    "comprehensive": "-sS -sV -sC -A -T4 -p-",
    "stealth": "-sS -T1 -f",
    "vulnerability": "-sV --script vuln"
  },
  "threat_intel_apis": {
    "virustotal_api": "your-api-key",
    "shodan_api": "your-api-key"
  },
  "email_notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "smtp_server": "smtp.company.com",
    "recipients": ["security-team@company.com"]
  }
}
```

## Sample Output

          "service": "http"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
